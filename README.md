# Pong Game Server

This project implements a server for a classic Pong game, allowing two players to compete against each other in real-time. It's built using Go and utilizes gRPC for handling client-server communication. In addition, the server establishes a connection with the Bison Relay client, facilitating secure and efficient communication between the game server and clients. This setup ensures not only the management of game instances and player inputs but also the seamless streaming of game updates to clients through the Bison Relay infrastructure.
